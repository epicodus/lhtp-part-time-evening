The first is that employers often use it as a litmus test for whether you are invested in the job or whether you\u2019ve read the full job description. Sometimes just the presence of it makes a difference in your job prospects. There is a possibility that, if you choose the quick apply button when there are other options or email a resume in without a cover letter, that the employer may toss your application out before ever reading it.

If your resume is your opportunity to show them that your skills meet their requirements, the cover letter is your chance to make a case for why that merits further consideration.

It\u2019s important to understand that when you\u2019re entering a new industry, you don\u2019t have paid work or an internship yet to back up your assertions about your skills.
